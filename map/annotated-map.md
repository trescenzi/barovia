## A
### The Village of Barovia
  This is the town you setup shop in when you first arrived. Here you did a few things:
  - Left the werewolf who was your catalyst in finding Barovia to die in a basement of a house.
  - Found Irenia
  - Met a priest(Donavich) who suggested you take Irena to Krezek. You also met his son Doru who is a vampire spawn. You
    left him alive in Donavich's basement at his behest.
## B
### The Vistani Camp
  Here you encountered the Vistani for the first time. Here Madam Eva read your [fortune](../notes/fortune.md).

## C
### The Hag's Windmill
  Here you encountered a windmill full of hags. You trashed up the place and almost died. As far as you're aware there
  wasn't much there but you didn't really check either.

## D
### Strahd's Castle

## E
### The Town of Vallaki
  This town is lead by an insane Burgomaster who used to keep order by inflicting happiness upon his citizens. After
  being scared off by you his festivals have stopped. However the town isn't honestly any better off. Also of known and note here
  are:
  - Blinsky's toys: A toy shop full of dolls that look like Irena
  - St. Andral's Church: A simple church recently ransacked by vampire spawn and burnt to the ground. The priest died.
  - The Blue Water Inn: This inn is run by Urwin Martikov Davian's brother. He leads the Keepers of the Feather.
  - The Watcherhaus: You don't know anymore about this aside from the fact that it exists and is the family mansion of
    the Watchers.

## F
### Vistani Camp + Dusk Elf Internment
  Here is a Vistani camp that guards the remaining Dusk Elves. The Dusk Elves are prisoners in all but name as Strahd
  doesn't want them to be free to roam.

## G
### Krezek
  Krezek used to function like a commune. Those who lived there eked out a meager existence living off of the land. Now
  however due to the renovations at the Abbey of St. Markovia the town has kicked into high gear. The walls
  are higher, the wine is flowing and for the first time those living in Krezek have hope.

## H
### The Abbey of St Markovia
  Once run by an insane abbot the Abbey of St Markovia has been transformed by your passing. It now houses a small army
  of misfits looking to fight back against Strahd.

## I
### The Wizard of Wines
  This winery is run by the Martikovs and producing well since you returned the stolen seed. There is however a seed
  that's still missing.

## J
### Yester Hill
  This hilltop is on the very edge of Stradh's realm. Here lies the burial mounds of an ancient druid circle.

## L
### Toslenka Pass
  This pass through the mountains is the best way to get to The Amber Temple. At the river is an old bridge which you've
  never crossed. It was blocked by a curtain of green flame.

## M
### The Amber Temple
  This is where Kasimir the Dusk Elf wishes to visit to, as he puts it, release his sister's soul. As far as you've been
  told it's a temple where a secrete society of good wizards kept vessels of evil power that they captured and stored.
  It is likely fully of powerful and dangerous relics.

## N
### The Ruins of Berez
  This destroyed town is the home of Baba Lysaga.

## O
### Argynvostholt
  This mansion once housed the Order of the Silver Dragon. Long ago they tried to rise against Strahd and failed.
