# The Fortune of the Vistani

When you encountered Madam Eva she read your fortune and provided you with the following clues:

1. "This card tells of history.": Look for the one who sees all. The treasure is hidden in her camp.

  This lead you to finding a book detailing the history of Barovia and Strahd in Madam Eva's. It is said that Strahd
  would stop at nothing to get this book back. Luckily he doesn't know you have it.

1. "This card tells of a powerful force for good and protection, a holy symbol of great hope.": Find the Mad Dog's
   crypt. The treasure lies within, beneath blackened bones.
    
  You still haven't figured out where this might be. You do know what the Mad Dog is a famous general who lead war
  dogs under Strahd's army.

1. "This is a card of power and strength. It tells of a weapon of vengeance: a sword of sunlight": Seek a cask that
   once contained the finest wine, of which not a drop remains.

   You found The Sunsword in Strahd's wine cellar. You lost The Sunsword in battle with Baba Lysaga.

1. "This card sheds light on the one who will help you greatly in the battle against darkness": Find the leader of the
   feathered ones who live among the vines. Though old, he has one more fight left in him.

   You found this card to reference Davian Martikov. He's the owner of The Wizard of Wines. You've left the winery in
   the change of his family and brought him with you to your stronghold in Krezek. He's become friends with Muriel
   Vinshaw and together they've been building a resitance group of wereravens providing you with access
   to a network of spies(The Keepers of the Feather) across Barovia.

1. "Your enemy is a creature of darkness, whose powers are beyond mortality. This card will lead you to him!": He
   lurks in the depths of darkness, in the one place he must return.
